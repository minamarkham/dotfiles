# ~/.zprofile :: Login shell config (runs once per login)
# =========================================================================
# .zprofile is sourced on login shells and before .zshrc.
#  As a general rule, it should not change the shell environment at all.

# === PATH setup ===
# Prepend user-local bin directories
export PATH="$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

# === Environment variables ===
[[ -f $ZDOTDIR/.exports ]] && source $ZDOTDIR/.exports

# === Agents (login-only background services) ===
# Homebrew shell setup
[[ -x /opt/homebrew/bin/brew ]] && eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

# === Source ~/.zshrc for interactive setup ===
[[ -f "$HOME/.zshrc" ]] && source "$HOME/.zshrc"
